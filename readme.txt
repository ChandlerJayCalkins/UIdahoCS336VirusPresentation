How to turn off the virus:
	1. Press "CTRL + ALT + DELETE"
	2. Click on "Task Manager"
	3. Inside Task Manager, scroll down and look for the task named "Microsoft Windows Based Script Host" with the process name "wscript.exe" (It has a red, gree, and blue cube as an icon)
	4. Click on that process and select "End Task" in the bottom right of task manager (after this, the virus script should not be immediately running anymore)
	5. Press "WINDOWS + R"
	6. Type in "shell:startup" and press "OK"
	7. In the file explorer, look for the file called "StartupController.vbs"
	8. Delete that file or at least remove it from the startup directory (the virus script will no longer run on startup)
